Recent advances in AI have led to breakthroughs in commercially important applications such as object recognition, natural language processing, and automatic translation.  However, the transformative potential of these advances is vastly untapped in high-stakes domains which demand a high degree of safety, trust, and privacy, such as healthcare, climate sciences, transportation/civic engineering, and robotics.  The goal of the event is to bring together researchers working on this topic in universities, corporations, and non-profit organizations across India, and potentially establish collaborations.
